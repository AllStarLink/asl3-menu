# AllStarLink Version 3 Menu

This repository contains the ASL Menu system. Previous versions of ASL contain the menu within the `app_rpt` source repository. The menu is now in its own repo allowing improvements to be made independent of `app_rpt`.

## Menu Design Goals

- This menu should only perform Asterisk and node configurations (i.e. editing the config files). OS settings such as setting the IP address, time zone, hostname, etc should be done with other tools.

- Initially, the menu may be a reworked ASL2 menu (the `asl-menu` script) updated for ASL3. At some point, maybe soon, this menu should use an API, perhaps Asterisk's AMI ([https://asterisk.phreaknet.org/#manageraction-UpdateConfig](https://asterisk.phreaknet.org/#manageraction-UpdateConfig)) in common with other utilities such as a web based system.

- Ideally, any tool that edits the configuration files should assume other tools including text file editors are also being used to update the configuration.  We need to ensure compatibility.

- The menu should auto launch with SSH login's but this functionality may be disabled or enabled from the menu itself or other utilities.

- If no node has been configured the menu should auto launch to the "add node" menu.

- Add node. Same data elements as Edit node.

- Delete node.

- Edit node data elements: Voice and CW IDs, channel driver, node number, node password, stat post (y/n), backup (call save_node script) node number and password, https registration node number and password.

- Enable/disable other utilities: Allmon3, Web menu

- Entry for simple-tune-menu (or itâ€™s replacement)
